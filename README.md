# Electron-NextJS Integration

This project demonstrates how to integrate Electron with Next.js, using TypeScript. It showcases a seamless way to build cross-platform desktop applications with modern web technologies.

## Features

- **Electron**: For building cross-platform desktop applications.
- **Next.js**: A popular React framework for server-side rendering and static site generation.
- **TypeScript**: A strongly typed programming language that builds on JavaScript.
- **TailwindCSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.
- **Automation**: A bat file to automatically run the application.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your system:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/DaviDbrBoy/electron-with-nextjs.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd electron-with-nextjs
    ```

3. Install the dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

### Running the Application

To start the application, you can use the provided batch file:

1. Run the bat file:

    ```bash
    run-start.bat
    ```

This will execute `npm run dev` and `npm run electron` commands concurrently.

Alternatively, you can run the commands manually:

1. Start the Next.js development server:

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

2. In a separate terminal, start the Electron application:

    ```bash
    npm run electron
    ```

### Scripts

- `npm run dev`: Starts the Next.js development server.
- `npm run electron`: Starts the Electron application.
- `npm run build`: Builds the Next.js application for production.

### Technologies Used

- [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/)
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
